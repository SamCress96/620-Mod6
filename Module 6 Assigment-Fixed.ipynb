      "<p>The first image brought to mind by the phrase “laser headlights” is that of laser beams firing out the front of an automobile. Obviously, coherent beams of monochromatic light would make for poor illumination outside of a very specific spot quite some distance away. Thankfully for our eyes, laser headlights don’t work in this way at all.</p>\n",
      "<p>Instead, laser headlights consist of one or more solid state laser diodes mounted inside the headlight. These blue lasers are fired at a yellow phosphor, similar to that used in white LEDs. This produces a powerful, vibrant white light that can then be bounced off reflectors and out of the headlights towards the road. Laser headlights built in this way have several benefits. They’re more energy efficient than LEDs that put out the same amount of light, while also being more space efficient, too.</p>\n",

      "<p>Laser headlights are still a nascent technology, thus far only appearing in a few BMW, Audi, and other select vehicles. <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210327165005/https://www.osram.com/am/specials/trends-in-automotive-lighting/laser-light-new-headlight-technology/questions-and-answers-on-innovative-laser-technology/index.jsp\" target=\"_blank\">BMW’s technology was developed in partnership with lighting experts OSRAM</a>. In practice, a regular LED low-beam lamp is used, with the laser used to create an incredibly bright and focused spot, used for high-beams. This can provide illumination out to 600 meters ahead of the vehicle, double that of conventional LED high beams. The lights use indium gallium nitride diode lasers that were originally used in projectors, with power levels above 1 watt. One of the challenges in implementing such technology in an automotive environment is the need for it to operate at temperature extremes. While research lasers and laser pointers may primarily be used at typical room temperatures, automotive headlights must be able to withstand everything from 40 degrees below zero up to 50 degrees C. Thankfully, the laser’s high efficiency means it doesn’t have huge heat output of its own to further complicate things. Other engineering challenges involve tailoring the optics package for the rough-and-tumble, high vibration environment found in the automotive application. It’s also important to ensure, as with any such device, that the end user can’t be exposed to harmful laser radiation in the event of accident or malfunction.</p>\n",

      "<p>An aftermarket has sprung up too, with delightfully innovative designs. Combined laser/LED headlights are readily available on Alibaba, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210327165005/https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001889968976.html?spm=a2g0o.search0302.0.0.5bebc1d45ruE7k&amp;algo_pvid=b016ca5c-d0fe-4309-ab5f-e39ea8770c80&amp;algo_expid=b016ca5c-d0fe-4309-ab5f-e39ea8770c80-0&amp;btsid=0b0a556516155071180373533e897a&amp;ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_,searchweb201603_\" target=\"_blank\">designed as a drop in replacement for projector lamps on existing vehicles.</a> These often use an LED low-beam, and a combined LED/laser high beam, where the laser diode shoots directly at the LED phosphor to excite it further, rather than using its own. These units often also come with fan cooling to keep the laser and LEDs below their maximum operational temperature. Such developments are exciting, though it’s important to be wary of the performance of unknown aftermarket headlights. <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210327165005/https://jalopnik.com/why-most-led-headlight-upgrades-dont-really-work-an-ex-1843070472\" target=\"_blank\">Many aftermarket LED headlight “upgrades” fail to pass muster</a> when it comes to real-world performance, and there’s no reason to believe hybrid LED/laser designs will be any different. We’d love to pass a selection of these parts through <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210327165005/http://www.vdrsyd.com/ancap_datasheets/xprotocol_archive/IIHS/headlight_test_rating_protocol.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">a full IIHS test protocol</a>, but that’s sadly beyond the scope (and budget!) of this article.</p>\n",
      "<p>However, [mikeselectricstuff] has happened to lay his hands on both the BMW and aftermarket parts, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210327165005/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fRjMHtnShs\" target=\"_blank\">tearing them all down in his workshop to see what makes them tick.</a> The differences are multitude when laid bare on the bench. The AliExpress part is relatively simple, wired up no differently from a regular headlight. Interestingly, however, the laser high-beam circuit runs all the time in these parts. To prevent blinding other road users, a shutter is kept in place to block the light, which is moved out of the way with a solenoid when the driver turns on the high beam switch.</p>\n",
      "<p>Where the aftermarket part is a little out of left field, the BMW design is another thing entirely. The cutting-edge headlights are hooked up with multiple connectors and over 30 conductors, with much of the driver electronics living in an external controller. Much of this is to drive the various LEDs and stepper motors for slewing the headlights when steering. However, the laser assembly brings its own complexities. Twin light sensors are built inside to monitor the laser beam, and a special metal blocking arm sits directly in front of the diode, presumably to stop the laser light leaving the headlight in the event the phosphor coating burns through. It’s truly wild to get a look inside a modern luxury car’s headlight and see just how far we’ve come from the old days of simple sealed beams.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Cost Versus Performance</h2>\n",
      "<p>Despite the efficiency gains available, the technology remains expensive. Powerful laser diodes don’t come cheap, after all. However, as the technology trickles down to lower-end models, it’s likely that we could see economies of scale change that for the better. Indeed, if national authorities begin to demand higher performance headlights as standard, we could see laser headlights become the norm, rather than an expensive luxury. The technology could naturally be applied to home and commercial lighting, too — though we suspect the potential gains are limited enough that LED lighting will remain the norm for some time to come.</p>\n",

      "When we think about the onward march of automotive technology, headlights aren’t usually the first thing that come to mind. Engines, fuel efficiency, and the switch to electric power are all more front of mind. However, that doesn’t mean there aren’t thousands of engineers around the world working to improve the state of the art in automotive lighting day in, day out.\n",
      "Sealed beam headlights gave way to more modern designs once regulations loosened up, while bulbs moved from simple halogens to xenon HIDs and, more recently, LEDs. Now, a new technology is on the scene, with lasers!\n",
      "\n",
      "The first image brought to mind by the phrase “laser headlights” is that of laser beams firing out the front of an automobile. Obviously, coherent beams of monochromatic light would make for poor illumination outside of a very specific spot quite some distance away. Thankfully for our eyes, laser headlights don’t work in this way at all.\n",
      "Instead, laser headlights consist of one or more solid state laser diodes mounted inside the headlight. These blue lasers are fired at a yellow phosphor, similar to that used in white LEDs. This produces a powerful, vibrant white light that can then be bounced off reflectors and out of the headlights towards the road. Laser headlights built in this way have several benefits. They’re more energy efficient than LEDs that put out the same amount of light, while also being more space efficient, too.\n",
      "Laser headlights are still a nascent technology, thus far only appearing in a few BMW, Audi, and other select vehicles. BMW’s technology was developed in partnership with lighting experts OSRAM. In practice, a regular LED low-beam lamp is used, with the laser used to create an incredibly bright and focused spot, used for high-beams. This can provide illumination out to 600 meters ahead of the vehicle, double that of conventional LED high beams. The lights use indium gallium nitride diode lasers that were originally used in projectors, with power levels above 1 watt. One of the challenges in implementing such technology in an automotive environment is the need for it to operate at temperature extremes. While research lasers and laser pointers may primarily be used at typical room temperatures, automotive headlights must be able to withstand everything from 40 degrees below zero up to 50 degrees C. Thankfully, the laser’s high efficiency means it doesn’t have huge heat output of its own to further complicate things. Other engineering challenges involve tailoring the optics package for the rough-and-tumble, high vibration environment found in the automotive application. It’s also important to ensure, as with any such device, that the end user can’t be exposed to harmful laser radiation in the event of accident or malfunction.\n",
      "An aftermarket has sprung up too, with delightfully innovative designs. Combined laser/LED headlights are readily available on Alibaba, designed as a drop in replacement for projector lamps on existing vehicles. These often use an LED low-beam, and a combined LED/laser high beam, where the laser diode shoots directly at the LED phosphor to excite it further, rather than using its own. These units often also come with fan cooling to keep the laser and LEDs below their maximum operational temperature. Such developments are exciting, though it’s important to be wary of the performance of unknown aftermarket headlights. Many aftermarket LED headlight “upgrades” fail to pass muster when it comes to real-world performance, and there’s no reason to believe hybrid LED/laser designs will be any different. We’d love to pass a selection of these parts through a full IIHS test protocol, but that’s sadly beyond the scope (and budget!) of this article.\n",
      "However, [mikeselectricstuff] has happened to lay his hands on both the BMW and aftermarket parts, tearing them all down in his workshop to see what makes them tick. The differences are multitude when laid bare on the bench. The AliExpress part is relatively simple, wired up no differently from a regular headlight. Interestingly, however, the laser high-beam circuit runs all the time in these parts. To prevent blinding other road users, a shutter is kept in place to block the light, which is moved out of the way with a solenoid when the driver turns on the high beam switch.\n",
      "Where the aftermarket part is a little out of left field, the BMW design is another thing entirely. The cutting-edge headlights are hooked up with multiple connectors and over 30 conductors, with much of the driver electronics living in an external controller. Much of this is to drive the various LEDs and stepper motors for slewing the headlights when steering. However, the laser assembly brings its own complexities. Twin light sensors are built inside to monitor the laser beam, and a special metal blocking arm sits directly in front of the diode, presumably to stop the laser light leaving the headlight in the event the phosphor coating burns through. It’s truly wild to get a look inside a modern luxury car’s headlight and see just how far we’ve come from the old days of simple sealed beams.\n",
      "Despite the efficiency gains available, the technology remains expensive. Powerful laser diodes don’t come cheap, after all. However, as the technology trickles down to lower-end models, it’s likely that we could see economies of scale change that for the better. Indeed, if national authorities begin to demand higher performance headlights as standard, we could see laser headlights become the norm, rather than an expensive luxury. The technology could naturally be applied to home and commercial lighting, too — though we suspect the potential gains are limited enough that LED lighting will remain the norm for some time to come.\n",
      "As it currently stands, much of the appeal of the new technology is about the packaging benefits, which allow automotive designers greater freedom around the headlight area. Such concerns are less of a factor when it comes to light fittings in the home or office, or indeed, on lower-end automobiles. Regardless, it’s an exciting new application for lasers and one we’ll be sure to see more of in the future.\n",
      " \n",
      "Headlights with…*pew*pew*pew*. But the main issue I find is how harsh they are on other drivers vision.\n",
      "As someone in my 50s, with naturally deteriorating eyesight, I am frequently dazzled by insanely bright HID or LED headlights.\n",
      "Laser excited phosphor headlights just sound like an tech overcomplication for up market German performance cars. Most people don’t want to, or are unlikely to ever drive at 240km/h at night on a German autobahn.\n",
      "Light emissions from these vehicles can be just as offensive as their tail-pipe emissions.\n",
      "If the designers are bored and want to put more tech into vehicles just for the sake of it, they might consider an infrared floodlight and an IR camera connected to a head-up-display. \n",
      "If you need to see 600m ahead of you in the dark – you are probably driving too fast.\n",
      "To be complete, these laser headlamps comes with a, intelligent driver that enable laser only under conditions (speed, steering wheel, no other car crossing).\n",
      "But in my own opinion, with these restrictions you can see at 600m when… there’s nothing to see. And who cares what’s happening at 600m ?\n",
      "I’m… just trying to parse this. You really think there’s no point to having vision out to 600 m (30 seconds at 70 kph) at night when there are no other cars on the road? There are things on roads other than cars, you know.\n",
      "A hard brake at 70 kph will take ~15 second to come to a stop, and carries a *big* risk if you’re the lead car with someone behind you. This basically *doubles* the visibility distance.\n",
      "I mean, yes, they’re a problem for oncoming traffic and drivers in front of you. That’s why they’re high beams.\n",
      "A full stop from 70 KPH takes FIFTEEN SECONDS?  You need to get your brakes checked…\n",
      "I don’t think so. An average car can do a hard stop within 70 meters from 70 kph (19.5 m/s) and that’s giving you two seconds of reaction time. Assuming linear deceleration, your average stopping time will be between 7-8 seconds. If you take twice that time, your brakes are shot.\n",
      "Second point is, assuming average eyesight, the smallest distinct object you can just about make out from 600 meters away would be the size of a football, if it has enough contrast with the background, but that would require daylight levels of illumination, and no vibration and shaking from the vehicle. In the dark, no matter how bright your headlights are, you would be lucky to make out an object the size of a truck at that distance. It’s just gonna be a blur.\n",
      "A lot of cars can do a 60-0mph stop in less than 200 feet. The heck are you driving for it to take 7-8 seconds?\n",
      "“Assuming linear deceleration, your average stopping time will be between 7-8 seconds. If you take twice that time, your brakes are shot.”\n",
      "Unless the road’s wet, in which case the general estimate is a factor of two increase in stopping distance, which hey, gets you to around that 15 second mark (okay, maybe 12-13 seconds, I did put an ‘approximate’ there). You don’t design safety for the *best* conditions. Should’ve clarified that better, though.\n",
      "“Second point is, assuming average eyesight, the smallest distinct object you can just about make out from 600 meters away would be the size of a football”\n",
      "… I’m sorry, do you generally worry about hitting footballs on the road? I’m pretty sure the main things I worry about on roads (deer, vehicles, trees) are *way* bigger than footballs.\n",
      "Besides, the main point isn’t seeing things at 600 m. It’s seeing things farther than ~200 m away, which is where normal high beams cut out.\n",
      "“A lot of cars can do a 60-0mph stop in less than 200 feet. The heck are you driving for it to take 7-8 seconds?”\n",
      "It’s *safety* design, not friggin’ NASCAR. Have you *seen* the way most people drive?\n",
      "ah yes, stoner reaction speed, I too live in a legal state\n",
      "My car does 60-0 (warm tyres and dry road) in about 10m.\n",
      "But I agree, seeing 600m in front would be useful, when doing much higher speeds.\n",
      "Bleh, dumb math correction: just ignore the time portion, that’s all screwed up. Just replace the entire first part with “you think there’s no point to having vision out to 600 m when stopping distances on a wet road at 70 *mph* would be around 200 m?”\n",
      "Don’t do conversions in your heads, kids.\n",
      "actually… lowering light concentrations increases the visibility for everyone.  bright lights reduce visibility for everyone for up to 20 minutes (the amount of time it takes your eyes to adjust)\n",
      "because eyeballs actually take time to fully adjust to a dark environment. \n",
      "vis-a-vie, when you flick a light switch off, you can’t see shit, but if you sit in that dark room for 20 minutes you’ll be able to see everything provided you don’t have poor eyesight. \n",
      "bright lights are for dip shits that don’t understand the basic principles of how their own eyesight works. \n",
      "there should be a small tax on the sale of every vehicle that goes toward adding a diffused ambient light to all major roadways so that way headlights are not even required.   \n",
      "and yes, diffused so that way the lights are not contributing to light pollution, and yes, we do have the technology (and it’s cheap) to create lighting in such a way. \n",
      "it’s appalling how many people (even here) don’t understand these basic principles.  bright headlights are dumb. focused headlights are even worse.   \n",
      "BMW’s headlights are garbage even though they have those ‘mitigating’ features, they still end up blinding you constantly.   They have had multiple iterations trying to do the same thing.  this comes from someone who worked at their manufacturing facilities. those headlights are a giant pile of irritating garbage and you will get my brights turned on every time i see them, because they don’t adjust properly or fast enough. it’s always too late, the tech literally doesn’t work well enough and they’re blowing a ton of money on learning how to properly blind the crap out of everyone on the road… but you can’t tell a german that they are wrong and their attempt to over engineer their way out of a problem is dumb… believe me, it’s a lost cause.\n",
      "As a bicycle rider, I fully concur. No smart sensor is going to detect me and prevent the high beams. At the same time my eyes are completely over exposed making me virtually blind and unable to see where the bike lane is. Or the bollards separating the car lane from the bike lane.\n",
      "When riding outside the city, I found I needed 2 lights, one angled down to see potholes, roadkill, etc in time, the other angled up to be bright enough not to get hit or get my retinas fried constantly with the high beams. \n",
      "You get that problem with car reversing lights also, some are just all brightness directed out parallel to the ground so other cars see you reversing, some actually provide illumination so you can see to reverse at night. The first type, you have to ride or tap your brakes all the time to dispel the inky blackness with the brake lights.\n",
      "FWIW I’ve worked on prototype LED headlight systems that look for oncoming traffic and cut out the LED’s that illuminate in that area, and about half my fellow LED lighting engineers are roughly as avid cyclists as I am.  We are thinking about and working on this.  In the US, the NTSB and DOT have functional requirements for automotive lighting that includes not blinding oncoming traffic.\n",
      "None of these “save the other drivers” technologies are good enough, at least not yet.  And based on the complaints here and elsewhere, it seems clear to me that the NHTSA, NTSB and DOT have all failed at their jobs.\n",
      "If these “functional” requirements don’t have metrics attached, isn’t it just someone’s subjectivity making the decisions?  Note the metrics that did/do exist for halogen lights are not sufficient in protecting other drivers from these new headlight technologies. New regulations are needed to address this increasingly complicated landscape of headlights.\n",
      "It would be great if they worked. So far the largest problem is that the lamps are bright enough that sufficient light is reflected down from the windshield to the dash and back to the windshield to leave very low contrast ahead of me from cars behind me. And they are always shown on desert-flat roads, without any consideration for cresting hills. \n",
      "But it’s great that you are working on this because the razor edge cut-off that drives 0% to 100% to 0% to 100% due to slight bumps in the road that wipe out all my night vision are really appreciated. Those DOT requirements are whatever the industry bought and paid for SAE specification says it is, and it says nothing about things like blinding amounts of light reflected up from wet roads.\n",
      "There is a demo of a system like this that used a DPL projector and camera that took this idea to the extreme.  It was able to steer the headlights around rain and snow in real-time.  Made a big difference too!\n",
      "But at least you could be seen earlier in the dark, if you have some retroreflectors Bikes have only a small silhouette and legal bicycle headlamps are only required to put out measly 10lm. That’s easy to overlook.\n",
      "Mike,  being America, politics tends to spoil legislation. The DOT  has lagged behind for decades, not because they’re dullards but from states having political bearing on lighting standards for vehicles. Finally, when round sealed beams went away as hood lines were lowered giving manufacturers more room to design custom headlights, we’re now flooded with halogen, hid, led and laser headlights. Politics will always interfere with science, engineering and technology.\n",
      ">If you need to see 600m ahead of you in the dark – you are probably driving too fast.\n",
      "+1\n",
      "This is yet another nonsense stuff so people that have enough $$$ (and an inverse proportional sized brain) for BMW, Audi, … can boast about their “cool car” that they use to speed like crazy and endanger other peoples live. We don’t need this.\n",
      "Said by the city dweller who has never been exposed to critters suddenly crossing your path aka deer, moose, racoons. The easier I can light them up hiding in the ditches the better. Racoons can do several thousand dollars of damage to your nice plastic bumpered car and integrated $600 plastic headlight lenses.\n",
      "Unfortunately there isn’t a cure for bad drivers. They include the ones who drive without lights as well as the a-holes who drive with their high beams and fog lamps on all the time.\n",
      "We just need to mandate that wildlife wear high-vis reflective jackets.  :)\n",
      "The irony is that the brightness is achieved by blue light, which kills your night vision and you can see even worse outside of the direct beam.\n",
      "Go 20 mph and the danger will largely be eliminated.\n",
      "Could the problem be poorly designed aftermarket LEDs?\n",
      "Low beams should have a solid cutoff line that’s about hood level, assuming the headlights are properly aimed.  \n",
      "I’ve seen a lot of aftermarket bulbs that won’t focus properly.  Even with a proper LED aftermarket bulb, I suspect that most people don’t bother checking the aim after they are installed.\n",
      "Driving too fast? No, never.\n",
      "Only sometimes the speed limits are too low.\n",
      "Yeah, at night they’re brutal, just like the “tuner look” xenon wannabes HID’s with extreme blue tint, or aftermarket xenon bulbs with such.\n",
      "Same with rear LED indicators that sharply blinks on and off, though those are useful on a bright sunny day, but a nightmare at pitch black night.\n",
      "Slap then on the “exterior light” sensor, so they fade in and out like a incandescent at night, but sharp at fulbright day.\n",
      "How long until a misaligned laser is shooting 1 watt beams down the highway blinding everyone unfortunates enough to cross its path.  I can already see the class action lawsuits. Just because you can do something, doesn’t mean you should.\n",
      "“Twin light sensors are built inside to monitor the laser beam, and a special metal blocking arm sits directly in front of the diode, presumably to stop the laser light leaving the headlight in the event the phosphor coating burns through.”\n",
      "From the article. If you want more info about it, you can watch mikeselectricstuff video about the headlights: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fRjMHtnShs\n",
      "Relying on mechanics and feedback loops, what could go wrong?\n",
      "The arm is fixed, and is almost certainly hefty enough to absorb 1-10w if laser energy without heating up all that much, so no burn through. Also, there’s no misalignment if the the laser housing is placed in a premachined or cast part with no option for adjusting the alignment. So basically as is designed, if the phosphor coating is destroyed and the arm isn’t a mirror, then all that happens is the lasert light gets scattered around the headlight interior and at best some leaks out but due to light spreading out, unless you where right up on the spot where the phosphor was you wouldn’t get enough laser energy hitting your eye to do any damage.\n",
      "Stop worrying about imagined danger when there isn’t any.\n",
      "With the vibrations, poor maintenance and how little laser energy it needs to damage the eye I’d say there is a very real danger still. If you can be 100% certain the heatsinking and orientation of the this blocking arm you are not putting it in a car in the real world, where the sudden shock of hitting a pot hole or curb and the generally harsh environment with constant vibrations of a bad road has broken things its not supposed to be able to many many times now…\n",
      "I’m sure its perfectly safe as a technology in the lab, will be fine in cars for a while, but at some point the housing will crack/bend, the arm will corrode, water can ingress etc etc, and being an invisible problem there will be stray lasers that can cause serious eye damage out there, because nobody noticed the failure yet (when its throwing dazzingly bright light hundreds of meters by design even shedding a sizeable percentage won’t be obvious to the driver much of the time, and cracked parts or water inside are not always visible without complete disassembly and possibly x-rays either)\n",
      " Therac-25 \n",
      "Great, now when is someone going to move the turn signals away from the headlights, so you can actually see them against the glare?\n",
      "Lots of cars have indicators on the side mirrors. One can only hope that becomes standard.\n",
      "I’ve seen a few cars where the headlight switches to a running light only when the indicator on that side is on. Mostly on the high end cars, but I think I’ve seen it trickle down to some Jeeps too.\n",
      "That said, +1 for indicators on mirrors as standard.\n",
      "Those indicators are too distracting even during the day, and worse at night. If I’m ever forced to own a car with them then my first ‘customization’ will involve diagonal cutters. Failing that, scuffing the lenses with sandpaper, followed by a coating of steel-filled epoxy.\n",
      "Effective and safe automotive illumination was a solved problem 30 years ago, and most subsequent ‘improvements’ represent a triumph of style over substance. Even a lot of LED lighting is a distracting and annoying nuisance, except in those instances where the PWM frequency is high enough where my eyes see only a faint flicker instead of the illusion that the lights are jumping around in mid-air.\n",
      "Where would one buy one of these 40W phosphor laser tube thingies?\n",
      "They have them in flashlight form now, but they look excessively dangerous and almost useless as a flashlight unless you’re lighting up something a mile away and have a scope or something.\n",
      "They’re really cool though.\n",
      "But where do I buy one? They seem like they might possibly be a cost-effective solution for my high-power visible-light laser needs for an electrochemistry project I’m working on. But I can’ t find these easily on aliexpress or anywhere. I probably don’t know the right keywords.\n",
      "They have flashlights like this? How much do they cost? One might be be able to replace an unobtainium projector bulb.\n",
      "This does really worry me. I already have problems with many HID headlights that are from such a focused beam of light that they are piercing at night and nearly blind me with oncoming traffic. This is only going to make it worse.\n",
      "We need much more diffuse light, not more concentrated light. Use LEDs across the entire front of the car – that will give much more light but also more diffuse so that it’s not going to kill my night vision every time I drive by one.\n",
      "Maybe it’s time I revisit my active shutter headlight idea.\n",

      " People designing headlights never drive at night in a landscape with hills. I have to forcefully look away to not be blinded by all those new types of searchlights lower safety significantly. And then of course the headlights that are adjusted too high because of load in the back of the car. I’m happy my car has sealed beam lights and is auto leveling.\n",
      "But yes. Those bmw’s, audi’s, vw’s, volvos and suvs are a safety hazard for the rest of the cars around them.\n",
      "If i’m in a bad mood, I just turn on my big lights if one is approaching me.\n",
      "How many lumens is enough you think.\n",
      "Pretty sure auto leveling is mandatory on cars in Germany with anything wilder than ordinary HID’s (along with headlight washers), but that doesn’t stop someone from fiddling with the “baseline” height screw, or bumblefuck on a crappy lowering kit.\n",

I have been cussing the led lights the past  10 years with the last 4 years really being a living hell driving in the dark during rush hours. My solution was to tone those car windows that the law permits over here and additonally gluing plastic toning films on the side windows so the films occultate the side mirrors when driving. An imperfect solution but in a pinch i can slide down the side windows and have normal mirror brightness when reversing in those dark winter months.

      "Not to discount the concern, since misuse or lack of maintenance is a definite concern, but as a reference point, a 2018 Subaru with LED steering-responsive headlights (that also aim lower when they detect the car is heavily loaded in the rear) has high beams that automatically dim when another car is seen. Not sure if you can turn off this feature, I’ve never wanted to.\n",
      "At some point the LED steering will start to malfunction and either fail to dim down, or point in random directions where it shouldn’t, and this will either be a very expensive fix, or you bodge it so it points in a fixed direction to get through the MOT test.\n",

      "The rule of thumb is that you should switch to low beams when the road ahead is illuminated by the other vehicle’s beams.\n",
      "Well, if two cars have 600 m beams, they have to both switch to low beams while they’re still a kilometer away from each other, and take a minute to actually pass.\n",
      "Actually, if both vehicles were travelling at ~60MPH, that would be ~11.185 seconds.\n",

      "Today they are for high beams. Then it will be for “safety” that it is transitioned to low beams. \n",
      "Recall that the SAE standards for low-beams assumed that the maximum illumination would be in the central area aligned with the filament, with fall-off to the edges to avoid a sharp transition, and then lamp makers used optics to drive the maximum allowable illumination to 100% of the field with no gradual drop-off, creating that blinding flash transition so popular today. Of course they also did that test with the mandated 12V supply even though autos run theirs at 14-15V, for a gain of around 20-40% in brightness over the test condition. At least with LEDs that lie no longer works, but the elimination of gradual falloff more than makes up. And, the original lamps had a spectrum with little blue in it; now that component that destroys night vision, is a large component.\n",

      "In stop/go traffic, you’re never going very fast. Each acceleration to 25 mph in a two-tonne car takes about 120 kJ of energy, which is worth 6 seconds of driving on the highway at 20 kW (27 HP) average power. Most of the fuel consumption is due to idle loss, which consumes about 1-2 kW to keep the belts turning while you’re waiting at the red lights.\n",

The BMW laser high beam light dot is 1/3 the size of the low beam led array yet shines with at least the same total brightness as the low light array.  It is a very elegant solution, but, considering the lenses, servos and electronics involved i doubt it is long lived, at least for the low beam.\n",

      "You had this same misconception last time we talked about light efficiency, and you’re still wrong. That 44% figure is efficacy, not efficiency. That means it is relative to an single-color 550nm (yellow-green) light source and you wouldn’t want to light a room with that anyway.\n",
      "No. You got it exactly wrong the last time. Efficacy refers to the number of lumens per Watt of the radiation, and luminous efficiency refers to the perceived brightness relative to 555 nm light. Then there is the overall luminous efficacy and efficiency of the source:\n",

      "This IS counting “watts photons visible light out  ÷ watts electrons in”.\n",
      "Of course here as well, the ideal 555 nm source is by definition 100% efficient. It converts energy perfectly to photons and produces light that is perceived the brightest.\n",
      "A “perfect white” source with no source losses and a color temperature of 5800 K, basically a black body spectrum truncated to the perceivable colors, would have an overall luminous efficiency of 37%. This improves as you make the spectrum narrower. Likewise, LED lights are able to overcome this only by compromising on the light quality with a CRI less than 100.\n",
      "If you have a white LED with a claimed luminous efficiency of 75%, I have some news for you: either they’re lying, or it’s nowhere near white.\n",

      "An ideal white LED with 100% source efficiency from electricity to radiation is 38.1–43.9% efficient in terms of visible light.\n",
      "All real world LEDs are much worse than this^, with typical source efficiencies in the 20-30% range, which drops the practical luminous efficiency down from the theoretical max 300 lm/W to around 75-100 lm/W and the overall luminous efficiency becomes 10-15%\n",

I don’t remember his explanation of why it was important to try to match color temperatures, but it made sense at the time.  \n",
      "Being able to change color temperatures on the fly sounds like a great idea though, and relatively easy to implement – there are definitely situations where warm white is advantageous (bad weather driving, seeing detail of snow covered roads) and other situations where cool white offers more performance (lets your eyes see further assuming clear skies.

      "0.09523809523809523 : When we think about the onward march of automotive technology, headlights aren’t usually the first thing that come to mind.\n",
      "0.0 : Engines, fuel efficiency, and the switch to electric power are all more front of mind.\n",
      "0.0 : However, that doesn’t mean there aren’t thousands of engineers around the world working to improve the state of the art in automotive lighting day in, day out.\n",
      "0.038461538461538464 : Sealed beam headlights gave way to more modern designs once regulations loosened up, while bulbs moved from simple halogens to xenon HIDs and, more recently, LEDs.\n",
      "0.1 : Now, a new technology is on the scene, with lasers!\n",
      "1.0 : Laser Headlights?!\n",
      "0.25 : BWM’s prototype laser headlight assemblies undergoing testing.\n",
      "0.13043478260869565 : The first image brought to mind by the phrase “laser headlights” is that of laser beams firing out the front of an automobile.\n",
      "0.0 : Obviously, coherent beams of monochromatic light would make for poor illumination outside of a very specific spot quite some distance away.\n",
      "0.14285714285714285 : Thankfully for our eyes, laser headlights don’t work in this way at all.\n",
      "0.25 : Instead, laser headlights consist of one or more solid state laser diodes mounted inside the headlight.\n",
      "0.0 : These blue lasers are fired at a yellow phosphor, similar to that used in white LEDs.\n",
      "0.045454545454545456 : This produces a powerful, vibrant white light that can then be bounced off reflectors and out of the headlights towards the road.\n",
      "0.2222222222222222 : Laser headlights built in this way have several benefits.\n",
      "0.0 : They’re more energy efficient than LEDs that put out the same amount of light, while also being more space efficient, too.\n",
      "0.1875 : BWM’s futuristic i8 was one of the first vehicles to ship with laser headlight technology.\n",
      "0.15 : Laser headlights are still a nascent technology, thus far only appearing in a few BMW, Audi, and other select vehicles.\n",
      "0.09090909090909091 : BMW’s technology was developed in partnership with lighting experts OSRAM.\n",
      "0.07692307692307693 : In practice, a regular LED low-beam lamp is used, with the laser used to create an incredibly bright and focused spot, used for high-beams.\n",
      "0.05263157894736842 : This can provide illumination out to 600 meters ahead of the vehicle, double that of conventional LED high beams.\n",
      "0.0 : The lights use indium gallium nitride diode lasers that were originally used in projectors, with power levels above 1 watt.\n",
      "0.045454545454545456 : One of the challenges in implementing such technology in an automotive environment is the need for it to operate at temperature extremes.\n",
      "0.07407407407407407 : While research lasers and laser pointers may primarily be used at typical room temperatures, automotive headlights must be able to withstand everything from 40 degrees below zero\n",
      "0.038461538461538464 : up to 50 degrees C. Thankfully, the laser’s high efficiency means it doesn’t have huge heat output of its own to further complicate things.\n",
      "0.0 : Other engineering challenges involve tailoring the optics package for the rough-and-tumble, high vibration environment found in the automotive application.\n",
      "0.03333333333333333 : It’s also important to ensure, as with any such device, that the end user can’t be exposed to harmful laser radiation in the event of accident or malfunction.\n",
      "0.29411764705882354 : Tearing Down the Laser HeadlightA marketing image showing the construction of an aftermarket LED/laser headlight.\n",
      "0.05555555555555555 : We’d take the laser power with a grain of salt — it’s difficult to imagine a 10 W laser shining directly on some small LEDs without melting a hole through the board in short order.\n",
      "0.0 : An aftermarket has sprung up too, with delightfully innovative designs.\n",
      "0.14285714285714285 : Combined laser/LED headlights are readily available on Alibaba, designed as a drop in replacement for projector lamps on existing vehicles.\n",
      "0.15151515151515152 : These often use an LED low-beam, and a combined LED/laser high beam, where the laser diode shoots directly at the LED phosphor to excite it further, rather than using its own.\n",
      "0.05263157894736842 : These units often also come with fan cooling to keep the laser and LEDs below their maximum operational temperature.\n",
      "0.05555555555555555 : Such developments are exciting, though it’s important to be wary of the performance of unknown aftermarket headlights.\n",
      "0.12903225806451613 : Many aftermarket LED headlight “upgrades” fail to pass muster when it comes to real-world performance, and there’s no reason to believe hybrid LED/laser designs will be any different.\n",
      "0.0 : We’d love to pass a selection of these parts through a full IIHS test protocol, but that’s sadly beyond the scope (and budget!) of this article.\n",
      "0.0 : However, [mikeselectricstuff] has happened to lay his hands on both the BMW and aftermarket parts, tearing them all down in his workshop to see what makes them tick.\n",
      "0.0 : The differences are multitude when laid bare on the bench.\n",
      "0.07142857142857142 : The AliExpress part is relatively simple, wired up no differently from a regular headlight.\n",
      "0.07142857142857142 : Interestingly, however, the laser high-beam circuit runs all the time in these parts.\n",
      "0.0 : To prevent blinding other road users, a shutter is kept in place to block the light, which is moved out of the way with a solenoid when the driver turns on the high beam switch.\n",
      "0.0 : Where the aftermarket part is a little out of left field, the BMW design is another thing entirely.\n",
      "0.04 : The cutting-edge headlights are hooked up with multiple connectors and over 30 conductors, with much of the driver electronics living in an external controller.\n",
      "0.05555555555555555 : Much of this is to drive the various LEDs and stepper motors for slewing the headlights when steering.\n",
      "0.125 : However, the laser assembly brings its own complexities.\n",
      "0.07317073170731707 : Twin light sensors are built inside to monitor the laser beam, and a special metal blocking arm sits directly in front of the diode, presumably to stop the laser light leaving the headlight in the event the phosphor coating burns through.\n",
      "0.03225806451612903 : It’s truly wild to get a look inside a modern luxury car’s headlight and see just how far we’ve come from the old days of simple sealed beams.\n",
      "0.08333333333333333 : Cost Versus PerformanceDespite the efficiency gains available, the technology remains expensive.\n",
      "0.1111111111111111 : Powerful laser diodes don’t come cheap, after all.\n",
      "0.04 : However, as the technology trickles down to lower-end models, it’s likely that we could see economies of scale change that for the better.\n",
      "0.12 : Indeed, if national authorities begin to demand higher performance headlights as standard, we could see laser headlights become the norm, rather than an expensive luxury.\n",
      "0.06060606060606061 : The technology could naturally be applied to home and commercial lighting, too — though we suspect the potential gains are limited enough that LED lighting will remain the norm for some time to come.\n",

      "0.07407407407407407 : As it currently stands, much of the appeal of the new technology is about the packaging benefits, which allow automotive designers greater freedom around the headlight area.\n",
      "0.0 : Such concerns are less of a factor when it comes to light fittings in the home or office, or indeed, on lower-end automobiles.\n",

      "0.08333333333333333 : How Laser Headlights Work        130 Comments      by:Lewin DayMarch 22, 2021\n",
      "0.09523809523809523 : When we think about the onward march of automotive technology, headlights aren’t usually the first thing that come to mind.\n",
      "0.0 : Engines, fuel efficiency, and the switch to electric power are all more front of mind.\n",
      "0.0 : However, that doesn’t mean there aren’t thousands of engineers around the world working to improve the state of the art in automotive lighting day in, day out.\n",
      "0.11538461538461539 : Sealed beam headlights gave way to more modern designs once regulations loosened up, while bulbs moved from simple halogens to xenon HIDs and, more recently, LEDs.\n",
      "0.2 : Now, a new technology is on the scene, with lasers!\n",
      "0.5 : Laser Headlights?!\n",
      "0.25 : BWM’s prototype laser headlight assemblies undergoing testing.\n",
      "0.17391304347826086 : The first image brought to mind by the phrase “laser headlights” is that of laser beams firing out the front of an automobile.\n",
      "0.047619047619047616 : Obviously, coherent beams of monochromatic light would make for poor illumination outside of a very specific spot quite some distance away.\n",
      "0.14285714285714285 : Thankfully for our eyes, laser headlights don’t work in this way at all.\n",
      "0.25 : Instead, laser headlights consist of one or more solid state laser diodes mounted inside the headlight.\n",
      "0.125 : These blue lasers are fired at a yellow phosphor, similar to that used in white LEDs.\n",
      "0.045454545454545456 : This produces a powerful, vibrant white light that can then be bounced off reflectors and out of the headlights towards the road.\n",
      "0.2222222222222222 : Laser headlights built in this way have several benefits.\n",
      "0.045454545454545456 : They’re more energy efficient than LEDs that put out the same amount of light, while also being more space efficient, too.\n",
      "0.1875 : BWM’s futuristic i8 was one of the first vehicles to ship with laser headlight technology.\n",
      "0.15 : Laser headlights are still a nascent technology, thus far only appearing in a few BMW, Audi, and other select vehicles.\n",
      "0.09090909090909091 : BMW’s technology was developed in partnership with lighting experts OSRAM.\n",
      "0.11538461538461539 : In practice, a regular LED low-beam lamp is used, with the laser used to create an incredibly bright and focused spot, used for high-beams.\n",
      "0.05263157894736842 : This can provide illumination out to 600 meters ahead of the vehicle, double that of conventional LED high beams.\n",
      "0.05 : The lights use indium gallium nitride diode lasers that were originally used in projectors, with power levels above 1 watt.\n",
      "0.045454545454545456 : One of the challenges in implementing such technology in an automotive environment is the need for it to operate at temperature extremes.\n",
      "0.1111111111111111 : While research lasers and laser pointers may primarily be used at typical room temperatures, automotive headlights must be able to withstand everything from 40 degrees below zero\n",
      "0.038461538461538464 : up to 50 degrees C. Thankfully, the laser’s high efficiency means it doesn’t have huge heat output of its own to further complicate things.\n",
      "0.0 : Other engineering challenges involve tailoring the optics package for the rough-and-tumble, high vibration environment found in the automotive application.\n",
      "0.03333333333333333 : It’s also important to ensure, as with any such device, that the end user can’t be exposed to harmful laser radiation in the event of accident or malfunction.\n",
      "0.29411764705882354 : Tearing Down the Laser HeadlightA marketing image showing the construction of an aftermarket LED/laser headlight.\n",
      "0.08333333333333333 : We’d take the laser power with a grain of salt — it’s difficult to imagine a 10 W laser shining directly on some small LEDs without melting a hole through the board in short order.\n",
      "0.0 : An aftermarket has sprung up too, with delightfully innovative designs.\n",
      "0.14285714285714285 : Combined laser/LED headlights are readily available on Alibaba, designed as a drop in replacement for projector lamps on existing vehicles.\n",
      "0.15151515151515152 : These often use an LED low-beam, and a combined LED/laser high beam, where the laser diode shoots directly at the LED phosphor to excite it further, rather than using its own.\n",
      "0.10526315789473684 : These units often also come with fan cooling to keep the laser and LEDs below their maximum operational temperature.\n",
      "0.05555555555555555 : Such developments are exciting, though it’s important to be wary of the performance of unknown aftermarket headlights.\n",
      "0.0967741935483871 : Many aftermarket LED headlight “upgrades” fail to pass muster when it comes to real-world performance, and there’s no reason to believe hybrid LED/laser designs will be any different.\n",
      "0.0 : We’d love to pass a selection of these parts through a full IIHS test protocol, but that’s sadly beyond the scope (and budget!) of this article.\n",
      "0.0 : However, [mikeselectricstuff] has happened to lay his hands on both the BMW and aftermarket parts, tearing them all down in his workshop to see what makes them tick.\n",
      "0.0 : The differences are multitude when laid bare on the bench.\n",
      "0.07142857142857142 : The AliExpress part is relatively simple, wired up no differently from a regular headlight.\n",
      "0.14285714285714285 : Interestingly, however, the laser high-beam circuit runs all the time in these parts.\n",
      "0.02857142857142857 : To prevent blinding other road users, a shutter is kept in place to block the light, which is moved out of the way with a solenoid when the driver turns on the high beam switch.\n",
      "0.0 : Where the aftermarket part is a little out of left field, the BMW design is another thing entirely.\n",
      "0.04 : The cutting-edge headlights are hooked up with multiple connectors and over 30 conductors, with much of the driver electronics living in an external controller.\n",
      "0.1111111111111111 : Much of this is to drive the various LEDs and stepper motors for slewing the headlights when steering.\n",
      "0.125 : However, the laser assembly brings its own complexities.\n",
      "0.0975609756097561 : Twin light sensors are built inside to monitor the laser beam, and a special metal blocking arm sits directly in front of the diode, presumably to stop the laser light leaving the headlight in the event the phosphor coating burns through.\n",
      "0.06451612903225806 : It’s truly wild to get a look inside a modern luxury car’s headlight and see just how far we’ve come from the old days of simple sealed beams.\n",
      "0.08333333333333333 : Cost Versus PerformanceDespite the efficiency gains available, the technology remains expensive.\n",
      "0.1111111111111111 : Powerful laser diodes don’t come cheap, after all.\n",
      "0.04 : However, as the technology trickles down to lower-end models, it’s likely that we could see economies of scale change that for the better.\n",
      "0.12 : Indeed, if national authorities begin to demand higher performance headlights as standard, we could see laser headlights become the norm, rather than an expensive luxury.\n",
      "0.06060606060606061 : The technology could naturally be applied to home and commercial lighting, too — though we suspect the potential gains are limited enough that LED lighting will remain the norm for some time to come.\n",
      "0.08695652173913043 : The high light output of laser headlights in a compact package allows engineers greater freedom when designing the front-end of a car.\n",
      "0.07407407407407407 : As it currently stands, much of the appeal of the new technology is about the packaging benefits, which allow automotive designers greater freedom around the headlight area.\n",
      "0.0 : Such concerns are less of a factor when it comes to light fittings in the home or office, or indeed, on lower-end automobiles.\n",
      "0.045454545454545456 : Regardless, it’s an exciting new application for lasers and one we’ll be sure to see more of in the future.  \n",
